**Three Legged Bitch**

This here is a tiny, super simple https proxy, made with [https://github.com/mikeal/request]Request. You will need Node.js as well, and your own server.

You have to change the proxy settings on your computer, and maybe in your browser as well. Proxy HTTP request to localhost:8000

Start localhost.js on your machine.

Start remoteHost.js on your server.

**limitations**

Gzipped data gets downloaded like a file (using Chrome). I don't know what to do about it. 
Probably there are other things. But just look how simple it is.
